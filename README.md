# E-Commerce

## Description

This is the code for the back end of an e-commerce website. It utilizes JavaScript, Express, mysql, and Sequelize to create a database with API routes to make HTTP requests. The user can use CRUD methods to interact with the database.

## Installation

Go to the terminal, run `npm install`, sign into mysql, run `SOURCE db/schema.sql;`, run `quit;`, next `npm run seed`, and finally `npm start`.

## Usage

This is a back end application that utilizes CRUD so the user will need to use a REST client like Insomnia or Postman to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to access and interact with the database.
